                    I did this project as part of the course "Understanding User Needs" offered by the University of Michigan through Coursera. It was not commissioned by or for Amazon Prime Video in any way.

            <p>Amazon Prime Video is a subscription video-on-demand over-the-top streaming and rental service, offering movies, TV shows, documentaries, etc. In my observation, people I knew seemed to prefer some competitors of Amazon Prime Video in spite of higher subscription charges, and not just for the content being offered. The goal of this study is <mark>to discover viewers' needs and pain points</mark> when using Amazon Prime Video.</p>
            <p><strong>The overarching question:</strong></p>
            <p>What do users find difficult or frustrating while using Amazon Prime Video?

            <p>Insights from this study will indicate problem areas that may be prioritized to deliver an improved experience <mark>to retain more viewers</mark> of Amazon Prime Video, translating to higher revenue.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
            <p>Semi-structured Interviews <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Data Extraction and Analysis <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Findings and insights <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Design suggestions

            <p>Amazon Prime Video is available on several types of devices. To learn about viewers' experiences, I would have preferred to interview 8-12 individuals per device type with a distinct interface. However, as the solo researcher, given the time constraints, I recruited <mark>4 participants</mark>. One of them used the app on a smartphone, one on a laptop and two on TV.
              <mark>Audio recordings</mark> and <mark>anonymized responses</mark> were collected with informed consent.
              Participant recruitment was done by <mark>convenience sampling</mark> and <mark>semi-structured interviews of 45-60 minutes each</mark> were conducted remotely over video conferencing.</p>
            <p>Using the <mark>event reconstruction</mark> technique for more reliable recollection, I asked questions about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use patterns</li>
              <li>Preferences</li>
              <li>Difficulties/frustrations encountered</li>
              <li>Attempts to work around those problems</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="insights" class="mb-3">Key Findings and Insights</h2>
            <p>All four participants reported having <mark>spent a lot of time on selecting content to watch, sometimes giving up and exiting</mark> Prime Video as a result. I have selected two key findings related to this issue to expand on. Both these findings relate to the user’s experience from the time they come to Prime Video until they actually start streaming content.</p>

            <p><strong>1. Recommendations and search results are the two main sources of content discovery, but they are tedious and slow to use on TV.</strong></p>
            <p>It was found that most people only use the recommendation section and the search bar to find new content to watch, and the ‘Continue Watching’ section to resume half-watched movies or ongoing TV shows. The home page displays all of the content on Prime Video occupying many rows, but most people do not scroll past the first two rows which are the ‘Recommended’ and ‘Continue Watching’ sections. Those that do, reported having wasted a lot of time scrolling, trying to decide what to watch. One participant reported that they find the categorized titles on the home page irrelevant to their interests. Another reported using the search box to search in a particular genre or language rather than scrolling down to that category.</p>
            <p>The recommendations and search box remain the go-to sources for content discovery across devices, but they are especially hard to use while using Prime Video on TV. The recommendations are displayed as a single row of title cards, so <mark>only a few titles are visible at a time</mark>. Scrolling horizontally on TV requires the user to click through each item up to the last item on the right, after which one new item at a time is revealed. People find this <mark>slow and restricting</mark>. Using the search box on TV is hard because <mark>typing is slowed down</mark> by the combination of a virtual keyboard and a remote control (usually for the Amazon Firestick) operating it.</p>
            <p>Usability heuristics violated:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>#7 Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
              <li>#8 Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Design suggestions:</strong></p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>Recommendations might be better displayed in <mark>multiple rows with smooth scrolling</mark>. (It will require further research and testing on different devices to determine whether this will work, and with how many rows.)</p>
                <p>Instead of navigating a virtual keyboard with arrow keys, it would be more efficient to use a <mark>remote control that can type alphabets with the number pad</mark>. The Amazon Firestick remote control does not do this.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <img src="images/remote.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A traditional TV remote control with a number pad that can also type alphabets.">

            </div>

            <br>
            <p><strong>2. The search function is unreliable for a user trying to determine if they will be able to watch what they have in mind with the Prime Video subscription that they have.</strong></p>
            <p>When a user has something in mind that they want to watch, they often do not know whether it is available with their Prime Video subscription or not. Titles appear in the live suggestions while typing in the search box even if they are not available. The <mark>search results are not clear about the availability of a title</mark>. One participant reported that when the show they were looking for did not show up in the results, they first thought they got the name wrong, and then assumed it was unavailable. Another reported scrolling through the results and assuming their movie was unavailable when they could not see it. On TV, search results include titles that are unavailable with a Prime user’s subscription, but available on another OTT platform. This is <mark>misleading</mark> and the user only finds out after clicking on the title card. Participants reported <mark>routinely doing a Google search on a title instead of using Prime Video’s search</mark> functionality to determine its availability on Prime. </p>
            <p>Usability heuristics violated:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>#4 Consistency and standards</li>
              <li>#8 Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
              <li>#5 Error Prevention</li>
              <li>#9 Recognize, diagnose & recover from errors</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Design suggestions:</strong></p>
            <p>The user should not have to leave Prime Video to get the basic question of availability answered. Live suggestions and title cards in search results on TV <mark>should be clearly marked as unavailable</mark>. Finding out a title is not available after thinking that it is, is more unpleasant. Search results should clearly indicate unavailability to eliminate feelings of uncertainty. </p>
            <p>Viewing <mark>suggestions displayed on the search results page should be well separated and labelled</mark> so they are not erroneously perceived as search results, whose irrelevance to the search was irritating according to one participant. </p>

            <h2 id="reflection" class="mb-3">Reflection</h2>
            <p>About 2 years after I did this project, Amazon Prime Video rolled out a redesign that addressed some of the problems that this study identified.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A new side navigation to make it easier to find something to watch.</li>
              <li>Icons on title cards that show whether content is included with an Amazon Prime subscription.</li>
              <li>A new virtual keyboard layout that makes typing with a remote control faster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I especially appreciate the keyboard layout modification as a solution that immediately improves the experience for all current users without the need for a hardware change.</p>
