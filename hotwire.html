              Hotwire.com is a travel booking website that offers cheap booking options for flights, cars and hotels for people’s travel plans as well as discounted vacation bundles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can experienced users of online travel booking sites use hotwire.com to plan their trips?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What problems do users encounter when trying to use the site to plan their trips?</strong>
            </p>

            <p> <strong>Business Opportunity:</strong> </p>
            <p>Insights from this study will indicate problem areas that may be prioritized to deliver an improved experience <mark>to attract and retain more users</mark> of hotwire.com, translating to higher revenue.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
            <p>Pre-test interview, Moderated usability test, Post-test questionnaire <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Data Analysis <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Reporting insights</p>

            <p>The principal audience identified for this study is <mark>“experienced users of online travel booking sites”</mark>. The recruitment criteria was defined as those adults who had-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>bought a plane ticket online in the past year.</li>
              <li>not used hotwire.com before.</li>
              <li>have native or bilingual fluency in English. (since the site is in English)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To evaluate the site, I would have preferred to conduct test sessions with 5-7 individuals. However, as the solo researcher, given the time constraints, I recruited <mark>four participants</mark> by convenience sampling. All were habitual with using a laptop.</p>
            <p>A short <mark>pre-test interview</mark> was conducted to characterize the <mark>participants’ experience with the site, their travel experience and booking preferences</mark>.</p>

                            You are flying to London with your parents and 4-year-old sister in the 2nd week of January to stay with cousins for a couple of months. Since your sister is little, you prefer a direct flight. (If not available, a layover of less than 3 hours is okay). You will be departing from Mumbai. You do not want to travel to the airport at odd hours, so you are looking for a flight leaving between 10 am and midnight . Your little sister gets fussy and your mother wants to keep her occupied watching cartoons during the flight. You want to sit in a window seat if available. The trip should not cost more than Rs. 4 lakh. How much luggage can you take at no extra cost? How long will you have to wait in layovers?

            <p>I had objectively defined the success criteria for each test task in the form of a "correct answer" the participant should have. I noted success/failure for each task on my logging sheets. During each task, I asked participants to tell me when they felt they had finished a task.
              I <mark>compared task success rates, time spent on each task and the number of errors</mark> that participants committed during each task.

            <p>The usability test revealed several issues that require fixing, however <mark>the overall sentiment towards the site was positive</mark>. All four participants said they would include hotwire.com in flight ticket price comparisons as they do other similar sites.</p>

            <p>The SUS scores for perceived usability are scattered between 65(below average) and 95(very good); no conclusion can be drawn from these especially considering the small sample size. </p>

            <p>In addition to the 6 key findings elaborated below, <br>

Two of the four participants did not figure it out and <mark>abandoned the task</mark>. The other two who did eventually realize that the “Hot Rate” offer would not let them know the exact hotel address before booking took an <mark>average of 11 minutes to complete</mark> the task.</p>
                    <p>The scheme was explained on each Hot Rate listing page and even the two participants who gave up had read the description, but it <mark>appears that it was not clear enough</mark>.</p>

            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
            <p>A redesign of the hotel listings is required to make the concept of Hot Rate hotels more apparent and to properly separate them from the standard listings.</p>

                    <p>The Hotel search results page provides a way to filter results by price range in the form of a slider. The slider moves in $1 increments over a large range like $200+. </p>
                    <p>All four participants of the study had to move the slider slowly and carefully to apply their desired price cap with precision, <mark>over-sliding and correcting a few times</mark>. While three were not particularly annoyed by this, one participant who took longer than the others to get it right did express irritation.</p>

              </div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
            <p>A slider that moves in larger increments will support the physical capability for coarser motor control. However, checkboxes to select relatively broad price ranges as on Amazon, or numeric input fields would be more suitable input methods for price range.</p>
